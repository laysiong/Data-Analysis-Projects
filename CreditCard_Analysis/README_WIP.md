</p>

<h3> What is their risk profile? </h3>
<p> I created a risk profile based on 2 factors, first are the payments on time, and did the spent pass their credit limit monthly? Based on that, we will assign a score to each client to determine its risk profile. 

Distribution of Repay to Spend Amount Raito across Ages, there is a number of people that are in debt but they are quite close to paying up debt. There are few clients that pay amounts that exit further from what they spend on. It could be a repayment of their previous debt that is not recorded in the data. 

Distribution of Risk Groups Across Ages, there seems to be a group of clients under 60 who fall into the high-risk profile.
