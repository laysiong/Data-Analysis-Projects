<h3>Information on general trend market on Amazon</h3>
About <b>27.8%</b> of shipped transactions on Amazon are fulfilled by merchants, contributing to <b>27.9%</b> of the platform’s shipped sales revenue. This indicates a relatively balanced distribution of product value between Amazon’s and merchants' sales, highlighting the substantial role of merchants in the Amazon ecosystem right from the start.

The sales pattern seen here remains consistent across the top 10 countries with the highest purchase volumes on Amazon. Nonetheless, it's imperative to understand that these findings primarily illuminate current market inclinations and should not be solely used to make inventory stocking choices. The primary objective of presenting this information is to confirm and understand the existing trends in sales.
